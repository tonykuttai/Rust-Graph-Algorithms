Problem Statement:

  To check whether the input graph is a tree or not.

Logic: Tree is an acyclic connected graph.


Input: Graph is inputed as an adjacency list in the following format. Firstline
contains the number of nodes in the graph. Input is read from an input file.

[ Nodes ]
[ Adjacency List]

eg:
      3
      0 1 1
      0 0 1
      0 0 0

Output:
Ouput will give the number of nodes in the graph, whether it is a tree or not and
the running time of the algorithm.

eg:
Input read..W_input_not_tree_7.txt
Nodes     :   3
Not a tree
Parallel Running Time     : 0.0000975132 Seconds

Detailed Logic Explanation:

Logic is to remove leaf nodes iteratively till no more nodes can be deleted. If given 
graph is a tree then all the nodes will be deleted otherwise some nodes will remain. I 
will check if all the nodes are visited and non can be removed then there is cycle and 
graph is not a tree otherwise it is tree.
